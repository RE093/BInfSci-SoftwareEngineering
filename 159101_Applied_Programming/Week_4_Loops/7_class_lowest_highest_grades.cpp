/**

7. Each student in a class of unknown size has received a test mark out of 30. Write a program that
reads in the test mark for each student, ending input with a -1 (trailing value). Check that each mark is a
valid mark from 0 to 30. The program must display the highest and lowest marks for the test. The display
should look something like this when it runs:
Enter the mark for student 1: 27
Enter the mark for student 2: 11
etcâ€¦
Enter the mark for student n: -1
Highest mark: 29
Lowest mark: 5
